I have designed an armpit wearable, the features are mentioned below :-


1.  Odour remover through perforated foam, can be refilled eaily using holes in the middle.
2.  Temperature senor.
3.  Repetition Counter using peizo sensor in left side of the foam.
4.  easily wearble on any arm as its outer covering is in a shaped of a conical donut , which will give enough friction.
5.  it also has some upliftments for preventing the foam to stick on the body while wet, though it makes the appearance a little bad but will improve the quality of the project,
    colouring the project makes it look better.
